The following folders contain the implementation for stochastic subgradient descent and stochastic subgradient descent with momentum trained on multi-layer ReLU network and regression model and images of plots that compare their performance regarding training loss and test accuracy vs the number of epochs:

1. mnist_sgd trains a ReLU neural network using stochastic subgradient descent for the Fashion MNIST dataset
2. mnist_sgd_with_momentum trains a ReLU neural network using stochastic subgradient descent with momentum for the Fashion MNIST dataset
3. boston_sgd trains a regression model using stochastic subgradient descent for the Boston Housing dataset
4. boston_sgd_with_momentum trains a regression model using stochastic subgradient descent with momentum for the Boston Housing dataset
