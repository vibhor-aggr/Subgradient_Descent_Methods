The followings folder contain the implementation and plots which are as follows:

1. mnist_sgd trains a RELU neural network using stochastic subgradient descent for the Fashion MNIST dataset
2. mnist_sgd_with_momentum trains a RELU neural network using stochastic subgradient descent with momentum for the Fashion MNIST dataset
3. boston_sgd trains a regression model using stochastic subgradient descent for the Boston Housing dataset
4. boston_sgd_with_momentum trains a regression model using stochastic subgradient descent with momentum for the Boston Housing dataset
