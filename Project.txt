Implement at least two of these variants of the sub-gradient descent method from scratch and compare them to train a multi-layer ReLU network and a regression model. Compare their performance regarding training loss and test accuracy vs the number of epochs. 
- Projected subgradient descent.
- Proximal subgradient descent.
- Stochastic subgradient descent.
- Stochastic proximal subgradient descent.
- Stochastic project subgradient descent.
- Stochastic subgradient descent with momentum.
