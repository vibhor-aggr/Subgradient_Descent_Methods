Implement at least two of these variants of the sub-gradient descent method from scratch and compare them to train a multi-layer ReLU network and a LASSO regression model. With appropriate acknowledgment, you can reuse ML model codes from some open-source repository or library. Compare their performance regarding training loss and test accuracy vs the number of epochs.
